### Ranum’s “Eleven’s Eggo Parantha”


**By: Ranum Khan**

*Cooking Time: As fast as Eleven steals waffles*

**Difficulty: Telekinetic**

---

**Ingredients:**

1. 2 paranthas (the normal kind, not the Upside Down kind… hopefully)

2. 1 egg

3. 1 tbsp butter

4. A sprinkle of chaos

5. Optional: Paglu’s brain cell (if found)

--

**Instructions:**

1. Heat the parantha while staring into the void dramatically.

2. Crack the egg on top like Eleven cracking bones.

3. Add butter because cholesterol is temporary, flavor is eternal.

4. Flip it with confidence (even if it lands on the floor — 3-second rule).

5. Serve hot and whisper: “Friends don’t lie, but breakfast does.”

**Why This Recipe?**

Because every morning, I wake up feeling like I survived the Upside Down and this parantha brings me back to life.
