# Recipe Name : Pickle & Marshmallow Lava Cake

** By :** Navaira 

** Cooking Time :** However long it takes (or until your neighbors call)

** Difficulty:** Impossible (unless you enjoy chaos)

## Ingredients:

1 cup mini marshmallows

2 dill pickles, chopped finely

1/2 cup chocolate chips

1/4 cup cream cheese

1 tsp smoked paprika (just to confuse everyone)

Secret ingredient: a tiny sprinkle of instant coffee (optional but encouraged—you’ll see why)

## Instructions:

  1. Preheat your oven to “whatever temperature feels right” (around 350°F/180°C works).

  2. In a bowl, mix marshmallows, chopped pickles, chocolate chips, cream cheese, smoked paprika, and the secret ingredient. Stir until it looks slightly horrifying but uniform.

  3. Grease a ramekin or small baking dish, then dump the mixture in.

  4. Bake for “however long it takes” (start checking at 10 minutes, but don’t be surprised if it’s still suspiciously gooey).

  5. Let it cool… if you can wait that long. Slice carefully (or just scoop with a spoon) and serve with a side of existential dread.

## Why This Recipe?

It tastes… like a dare. 10/10 for laughs, 0/10 for normal taste. Perfect for impressing (or terrifying) your friends!
