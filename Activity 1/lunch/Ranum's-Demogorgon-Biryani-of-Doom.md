### Ranum’s “Demogorgon Biryani of Doom”


**By: Ranum Khan**

*Cooking Time: However long the Demogorgon hunts*

**Difficulty: Forbidden by Hawkins Police**

---

**Ingredients:**

1. Rice – 3 cups
(Enough to summon a small army or one hungry Dustin)

2. Chicken – 1 kg
(Bone-in for extra dramatic effect)

3. Spice Level – “Hawkins Lab EXPERIMENT 11”

4. Red chili powder – 2 tbsp

5. Turmeric – 1 tsp

6. Coriander powder – 1 tbsp

7. Biryani masala – 2 tbsp
(Add more if you want the Upside Down to feel the heat)

8. Fried Onions – 2 cups
(Cry while cutting for maximum authenticity)

9. Yogurt – 1 cup
(To calm down the monster—maybe)

10. Oil/Ghee – ½ cup
(Your choice: healthy or tasty… you can't have both)

11. Ginger Garlic Paste – 2 tbsp

12. Whole Spices:

- Bay leaves – 2

- Black cardamom – 1

- Green cardamom – 4

- Cloves – 6

- Cinnamon stick – 1 small

- Salt – 2 tsp (adjust to taste)
(Or add enough to banish Vecna)

13. Aroma Boosters:

14. Kewra water – ½ tsp

15. Yellow food color – a pinch mixed in 2 tbsp milk

**Instructions:**

1. Marinate the chicken like you're preparing a forbidden ritual: yogurt, spices, ginger-garlic paste, fried onions, oil—EVERYTHING.

2. Boil the rice until 70% cooked (like Eleven’s powers: not fully unleashed yet).

3. Layer rice + chicken + rice again because balance is a myth in Hawkins.

4. Add fried onions, food color, kewra, and seal the pot like you’re hiding from the Mind Flayer.

5. Let it steam (dum) until your whole house smells like a Netflix plot twist.

6. Serve with raita, salad… and unresolved trauma.

If a Demogorgon ever chases me, I’m throwing this biryani at it.

Sit.
And start eating.
Victory.
