# 🥘 Activity 1: The Great Recipe Book Project

**Mission:** Build the world's most chaotic (yet organized) recipe collection!

### 📂 Project Structure
```

├── breakfast/
├── lunch/
├── dinner/
└── desserts/
```

### 🎮 How to Play... I mean, Contribute!

**Step 1: Pick Your Flavor**
Choose any folder (`breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, or `desserts`) where your recipe belongs.

**Step 2: Create Your Recipe File**
- Name it something fun: `your-name-dish-name.md`
- Example: `manzoor-biryani-magic.md` or `sarah-midnight-ramen.md`

**Step 3: Share Your Recipe**
Write your recipe in simple bullet points. It can be:
- ✅ A real recipe you actually cook
- ✅ Your grandma's secret recipe (with permission!)
- ✅ A hilariously bad recipe you invented at 3 AM
- ✅ "Cereal with milk" (we don't judge)
- ✅ A fictional recipe for "Invisible Soup"

**Recipe Format (keep it simple!):**
```markdown
